Widget that makes a file input field in a form that stores an image about to be uploaded to the server and also the data to crop this image.

## What is Upload Crop Widget?

This widget adds a new file input field that lets the user to upload images to the server through forms alongside the necessary data to be able to crop it.

## Installation

* Install [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/download)
* Install the package via [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) 
		
		"cyneek/yii2-widget-upload-crop": "dev-master"
		
* Profit!

## How it works

The widget will include by default all neccesary javaScript and fields in the form for its proper operation. Once the data has been sent from the form to the server, it will be necessary to get the file and crop data to be able to apply them to the model attribute and the image itself.

	echo \cyneek\yii2\widget\upload\crop\UploadCrop::widget(['form' => $form, 'model' => $model, 'attribute' => 'fieldName']);

Since this library it's a widget input field not linked to the ActiveForm system itself, there is the problem that it's impossible to make an input including all the default options and exceptions that the form that holds the widget has. This includes php or css changes, client validation configuration, and so on. To be able to solve this problem, the widget has an option that lets the developer adding the ActiveForm object into the widget, if defined, the widget will use it to make all the input fields.

## Recovering form image and cropt data

The form will send to the server the data this way:

* Image file: it must be assigned to the model attribute itself in the usual way. [For example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23592125/how-to-upload-a-file-to-directory-in-yii2?answertab=active#tab-top)

* Cropping values: they will be sent to Yii 2 in array form:


		["fieldName-cropping"]=>
		  array(4) {
			["x"]=>
				string(1) "12"
			["width"]=>
				string(3) "400"
			["y"]=>
				string(1) "0"
			["height"]=>
				string(3) "297"
		  }


## Widget method options

* model (string) (obligatory)
> Defines the model that will be used to make the form input field.


* attribute (string) (obligatory)
> Defines the model attribute that will be used to make de form input field.


* form (ActiveForm) (optional)
> Its the ActiveForm object that defines the form in which the widget it's included. It will be used to inherit the form config when making the input field.


* enableClientValidation (boolean) (optional)
> Used when the form option it's not defined. It establishes if it's or isn't activated in the widget input fields the Yii2 javaScript client validation.


* imageOptions (array) (optional)
> List with options that will be added to the image field that will be used to define the crop data in the modal. The format should be ['option' => 'value'].

* jcropOptions (array) (optional)
> List with options that will be added in javaScript while creating the crop object. For more information about which options can be added you can [read this web](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropper#options).

* maxSize (integer) (optional)
> Being 300 by default, it's the attribute that defines the max-height and max-width that will be applied to the preview image that it's shown after selecting a crop zone.
